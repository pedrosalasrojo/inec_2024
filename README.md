# Ex-ante Inequality of Opportunity

This repository includes the basic data, scripts and references to estimate ex-ante Inequality of Opportunity (IOp) using Conditional Inference Trees and Random Forests. This material was used on a workshop organized by the Instituto Nacional de Estad√≠stica y Censos (INEC) in Ecuador.

- The folder "references" includes the basic bibliography.
- The folder "scripts" includes the functions needed to estimate IOp (0_functions.R), a file with an example to estimate IOp in Ecuador 2014 and some exercises (1_exante_iop_withtuning.R) and a file with some solutions to exercises proposed (2_exercises.R). The folder also includes a pdf (GEOM_EXANTE.pdf) describing the functions.
- Two .csv files. The file "ecu_14.csv" includes an anonymized and modified dataset representing Ecuador in 2014. The file "labels.csv" include the labels to interpret the categories and variables used in the analysis.
